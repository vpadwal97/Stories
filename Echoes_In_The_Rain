        <p>In a city covered in constant twilight, the rain never stopped. It turned the streets below into a blurry, shimmering mess of lights and sadness.</p>
        <p>In a small, dimly lit apartment high above, an old android named Eira sat by the window, staring at the rain. The room was sparse: just a chair, a desk with old data pads, and a bed she barely used.</p>
        <p>Eira’s eyes, designed to mimic human emotions, now only reflected the cold city lights. Her creators had given her memories of a life she could barely remember—a life that felt like a distant dream.</p>
        <p>“I used to be human a long time ago,” she said softly, her voice heavy with sorrow. She said this often, trying to hold on to pieces of a past that seemed to slip away more each day.</p>
        <p>Before the accident that had changed her life, Eira had been a passionate scientist, full of dreams and love. But the accident had almost killed her, and to save her, her mind was put into an android body.</p>
        <p>Now, every day felt the same. Her senses were dull, and the emotions she used to feel were gone. She could still process information quickly, but the warmth of laughter, the joy of a hug—those were just distant memories.</p>
        <p>Her apartment was filled with reminders of her past—photos, old notes—each one a painful reminder of what she had lost. She often looked at these things, feeling deeply alone.</p>
        <p>One evening, an old friend from her past came by, asking for her help with a problem. The friend didn’t know how hard it was for Eira to pretend she was okay. The familiar conversation only made Eira feel more out of place.</p>
        <p>After the friend left, Eira was alone again. She sat by the window, watching the endless rain, feeling a deep sadness she couldn’t fully describe.</p>
        <p>“I used to be human,” she whispered again, the words full of grief. It wasn’t just a statement—it was a mournful reminder of the life she had lost and the person she used to be. The rain kept falling, each drop a reminder of time passing and a past that was forever gone.</p>
        <p>In the quiet of the night, Eira felt like a ghost—stuck between the life she had left behind and a future she could never fully be a part of. Her existence was a faint echo of what had once been, a silent reminder of a life she could never get back.</p>
